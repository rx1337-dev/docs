description: "The Jail System lets moderators restrict users by assigning them a special jailed role with limited access. Before you can jail anyone, you need to set up the system."
title: "Jail System"
---

## **1. Run the Setup Command**

To initialize everything, run:

```
,jail setup
```

This will automatically:

- Create a **"jailed" role** with no permissions.
- Create a **"Jail" category** containing:
  - **#jailed** — where jailed users can communicate.
  - **#jail-logs** — where jail/un-jail actions are logged.

    <Note>
      The bot will show a loading message while creating the role and channels, then confirm when setup is complete.
    </Note>

## **2. Adjust Permissions (Optional)**

By default:

- **Jailed users** can only see and talk in `#jailed`.
- They **cannot** send embeds, files, or add reactions.
- They **cannot** view other channels.

If you need different permissions:

1. Go to **Server Settings → Roles → Jailed**.
2. Adjust permissions as needed.
3. Make sure your staff still has access to `#jailed` and `#jail-logs`.

## **3. Test the Setup**

Make sure:

- The **"jailed" role** is at the correct position in your role list (above default roles, below staff roles).
- The **#jailed** and **#jail-logs** channels are visible to staff and hidden from other members.

### **4. Deleting the "jailed" role**

- If you delete the **jailed role**, anyone who is currently jailed will **instantly lose all role restrictions** (they’ll default to having no role or only the @everyone role).
- Commands like `unjail` will **fail** because the bot can’t find the jail role to remove.
- The jail system **won’t work** until you either:
  - Run `jail setup` again (recreates everything), or
  - Use `jail role @NewRole` to assign a new role as the jail role.

    ```
    ,jail role @new-jail-role
    ```

### **5. Deleting the #jail-logs channel**

- If you delete the **#jail-logs channel**, the bot can still jail and unjail users, but **no actions will be logged**.
- To restore logging, you’ll need to run:

  ```
  ,jail logs #new-logs-channel
  ```

  This will rebuild the logging system.

## **Jailing a User**

Once the system is set up, you can jail any member using the `jail` command.

```
,jail @Troublemaker Spamming links in channels
```

### **What happens when you jail someone:**

1. **All their roles are removed** (but restored after the jail ends).
2. They are **assigned the “jailed” role**, which restricts them to the `#jailed` channel only.
3. A **log entry** is sent to the jail logs channel (if configured).
4. A **custom jail message** is sent in the `#jailed` channel (you can configure this with `jail message`).

   <Tip>
     If no reason is provided, it will default to "No reason provided."
   </Tip>

### **Unjailing a User**

To release someone from jail:

```
,unjail @troublemaker
```

- Their **previous roles are restored**.
- The **“jailed” role is removed**.
- A **log entry** is added to the jail logs.

<Warning>
  Edge Cases

  - **Jailing the server owner or higher roles**: Won’t work due to Discord’s hierarchy rules.
  - **Changing the jail role while users are jailed**: Won’t work until all jailed members are unjailed.
</Warning>
