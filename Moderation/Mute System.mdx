title: "Mute System"
description: "The mutechannel command tells the bot which channels to use for muting (text mutes, reaction mutes, and image mutes). When you mute someone, the bot will only apply permission changes in these channels."
---

1. **Decide which channels should be used for muting**\
   These are usually the channels where you want muted users to lose the ability to send messages, react, or upload files.

   ```
   ,mutechannel #general, #commands
   ```
2. **Review the list**\
   Use:

   ```
   ,viewmute
   ```

   This shows all channels currently set up for mutes.
3. **Change or remove channels later**\
   Running `mutechannel` with a channel that’s **already in the list** removes it.\
   Running it with a **new channel** adds it.

   <Info>
     **Important Notes**
     - Muted users will only be restricted in the channels you set here.
     - When you **add a new channel**, the bot automatically applies mute settings to existing muted users in that channel.
     - When you **remove a channel**, the bot removes special mute permissions for those users in that channel.
   </Info>

### **How to Use the Mute Commands**

The bot has **3 types of mutes**:

- **Text mute** → Stops a user from sending messages.
- **Reaction mute** → Stops a user from adding reactions.
- **Image mute** → Stops a user from sending images/files.

These only work in the channels you’ve configured with `,mutechannel`.

### **Step-by-Step: Muting a User**

1. **Mute a user**\
   Run:

   ```
   ,mute @User 10m, Spamming
   ```

   `@User` = the person to mute

   `10m` = duration (supports `s/m/h/d` like `30s`, `1h`, `2d`)

   `Spamming` = reason (optional)
2. **Reaction mute a user**

   ```
   ,reactionmute @User 30m, React spamming
   ```
3. **Image mute a user**

   ```
   ,imagemute @User 2h, Posting NSFW images
   ```
4. **Unmute a user**

   ```
   ,unmute @User
   ```

   (Same idea for `,reactionunmute` and `,imageunmute`.)
5. **To view users who are muted**

   `,muted` → view muted members

   `,reactionmuted` → view members who are reaction muted

   `,imagemuted`  → view members who cannot attach files

<Warning>
  **Important Notes**

  - You **cannot** mute users higher than you in the role hierarchy or the server owner.
  - Durations **cannot exceed 1 week**.
  - Mutes **auto-expire** at the set time.
  - When you change `mutechannel`, existing mutes automatically **resync** to the new channels.
