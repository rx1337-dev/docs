title: "Warn System"
description: "The Warn System allows moderators to issue warnings to users, automatically track their warning count, and apply automated punishments when thresholds are reached.
It also supports role-based thresholds, bypasses, and exemptions, giving servers fine-grained control over who can be warned and who can configure the system."
---

## **Features**

- **Warn users** with a reason (stored in a database).
- **Auto-punishment** when a user reaches a configurable threshold:
  - Timeout (with duration)
  - Kick
  - Ban
- **Role-based thresholds** (different thresholds per role).
- **Bypass & Exemption:**
  - **Bypass:** Allows users/roles to manage warn settings or thresholds.
  - **Exempt:** Prevents users/roles from being warned or punished.
- **Clear or remove warnings** individually, by user, or for the whole server.
- **Configurable thresholds & punishments** for all users or per role.
- **Logs with timestamps** for warnings and actions.
- **Reset** all warn configurations with one command.

## **1. Setting Up the Warn System**

Before using warnings effectively, you should configure the punishment and threshold.

### **Step 1: Set a Punishment**

Choose what happens when someone reaches the warning threshold:

- `timeout [duration]` – Temporarily time out the user.
- `kick` – Remove the user from the server.
- `ban` – Permanently ban the user.
- `none` – Disable automated punishments.

**Example:**

```
,warn punishment timeout 1h
```

This sets the punishment to a **1-hour timeout** when the threshold is reached.

### **Step 2: Set a Warning Threshold**

Set how many warnings a user can get before the punishment is triggered.\
**Example:**

```
,warn threshold 3
```

Now, after **3 warnings**, the configured punishment will be applied.

### **Step 3: (Optional) View Current Config**

Check what punishment and threshold are active:

```
,warn config
```

### **Step 4: (Optional) Add Bypass or Exemptions**

- **Bypass**: Roles/users who can change warn settings (e.g., moderators).

  ```
  ,warn bypass @moderators
  ```

  **Exempt**: Roles/users who cannot be warned or punished.

  ```
  ,warn whitelist @VIP
  ```

## **2. Using the Warn System**

### **Warn a User**

**Example:**

```
,warn @User Spamming channels
```

- Adds a warning to the user.
- If they reach the threshold, applies the punishment (timeout/kick/ban).

**View Warnings**

**Example:**

```
,warnings @user
```

- Shows all warnings for a user.
- If no user is specified, shows the **3 most recently warned users**.

### **Clear Warnings**

**Clear all warnings for one user:**

```
,warn clearall @user
```

**Clear all warnings for the entire server:** _(Owner or bypassed users only)_

```
,warn clearguild
```

**Remove a Specific Warning:**

```
warn remove @User 2
```

### **Manage Bypasses**

- Toggle bypass for a user or role:

  ```
  ,warn bypass @ModeratorRole
  ```

  View all bypassed users/roles:

  ```
  ,warn bypassed
  ```

### **Reset the System**

To completely reset all warn data and configurations:

```
,warn reset
```
