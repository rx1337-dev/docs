title: "Fakeperms"
description: "The Fake Permissions System lets administrators grant fake Discord permissions to roles.
These do not modify actual Discord permissions but allow roles to bypass permission checks inside the bot.

For example, you can give a role the fake manage_messages permission so users with that role can use commands that normally require Manage Messages — without giving them that permission in Discord."
---

## **How It Works**

- Fake permissions are **stored on the bot**, not in Discord.
- The bot uses `hybrid_permissions()` instead of Discord’s built-in permission checks.
- If a role has a fake permission (e.g., `manage_messages`), members with that role **can use bot commands requiring that permission**.
- These permissions **only apply to bot commands**, not actual server permissions.

## **Commands**

### **1. **`fakepermissions create [role]`

Sets up a role to use fake permissions.\
By default, it gets `manage_messages` as its first fake permission.

**Usage:**

```
,fakepermissions create helpers
```

### **2. **`fakepermissions delete [role]`

Removes all fake permissions for a role.

**Usage:**

```
,fakepermissions delete @Helpers
```

### **3. **`fakepermissions add [role] [permissions...]`

Adds fake permissions to a role.\
Supports **multiple permissions**, separated by spaces or commas.

**Usage:**

```
fakepermissions add @Helpers kick_members, manage_channels
```

<Warning>
  a `,` (comma) must be used to seperate each permission
</Warning>

### **4. **`fakepermissions remove [role] [permissions...]`

Removes specific fake permissions from a role.

**Usage:**

```
fakepermissions remove @Helpers ban_members
```

### **5. **`fakepermissions view [role]`

Shows all fake permissions assigned to a role.

**Usage:**

```
,fakepermissions view @Helpers
```

### **6. **`fakepermissions roles`

Lists all roles currently using fake permissions, who added them, and when.

**Usage:**

```
,fakepermissions roles
```
